# rFun-interp

An interpreter for rFun, the reversible functional programming language.

## Build and Installation

To build rfun-interp, run

    cabal configure
    cabal build

and to install

    cabal install

The program can also be run (assuming all dependencies are installed) by cd'ing
to `src` and then running

    runhaskell Main.hs

For more info about `cabal` see http://www.haskell.org/cabal/.

For building and installation using stack, run

    stack init
    stack install

and the interpreter can then be invoked like this:

    stack exec rfun-interp

However, that installation is only local to that folder; to make rfun-interp available
globally, edit your global config in `~/.stack/global-project/stack.yaml`
and add the directory in the `packages` array like so:

    packages:
    - /home/user/path/rfun-interp

and install it globally, outside the project directory, using

    cd
    stack install path/rfun-interp

Or, to run it directly using stack, use

    cd src/
    stack exec -- runhaskell Main.hs
